- This is **on-job PhD program** and **need the applicant has employee status** at the moment of application.

- The vision of this project is mainly to **provide a platform for those employees who want to improve their abilities to systematically learn new knowledge and improve their technical abilities**, and eventually obtain a doctorate degree

- Even so, the graduation requirements are exactly the same as those ordinary doctoral students, including qualification examinations, required courses, and requirements for publications.

- After **completing the compulsory and qualifying exams on 2019**, I take few days for carefully consideration about the next step.

- I decided to quit the job and focus on research to improve my research ability at same moment. After spending half a year handing over my job to a colleague, in 2020, I began to concentrate on research.

- After two years of training, **I can now consistently produce research results**. In addition, **currently is only one new paper left to complete (it will take one month, which will be done before onboarding)**.

- **After onboarding (if it happens), it's only taken me some free time to revise the paper that received review comments from a journal/conference. The advantage is that I can refine my understanding of SOTA AI/ML and get more practice, which helps with this job.**

## AI:ML Implementation

**In 2018, when I first enrolled in the course, I took the Deep Learning and Practice course, which required students to complete practical assignments on deep learning models every fortnight, which was my initiation process to deep learning.** 

1. Back-propagation from scratch 

> I have additionally made a practical analysis of the gradient descent process in order to understand the gradient descent process in more detail. 

2. Back-propagation through time binary addition (RNN)

3. EEG-classification (EEGNet DeepConvNet)

4. Diabetic retinopathy detection (ResNet18 ResNet50)

5. Generated images (InfoGAN)

6. English tense conversion (Conditional Sequence-to-sequence VAE)

7. Build a bot to play 2048 (RL Temporal Difference Learning)

8. Play CartPole-v0 and Pendulum (DQN DDPG)
