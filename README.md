## AI:ML Implementation

**In 2018, when I first enrolled in the course, I took the Deep Learning and Practice course, which required students to complete practical assignments on deep learning models every fortnight, which was my initiation process to deep learning.** 

1. Back-propagation from scratch 

> I have additionally made a practical analysis of the gradient descent process in order to understand the gradient descent process in more detail. 

2. Back-propagation through time binary addition (RNN)

3. EEG-classification (EEGNet DeepConvNet)

4. Diabetic retinopathy detection (ResNet18 ResNet50)

5. Generated images (InfoGAN)

6. English tense conversion (Conditional Sequence-to-sequence VAE)

7. Build a bot to play 2048 (RL Temporal Difference Learning)

8. Play CartPole-v0 and Pendulum (DQN DDPG)
